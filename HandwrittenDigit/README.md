# TensorFlow.js â€” Handwritten digit recognition with CNNs

https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tfjs-training-classfication/index.html

## Introduction

We'll build a TensorFlow.js model to recognize handwritten digits with a convolutional neural network.

**Supervised Learning** We will train the model by showing it many examples of inputs along with the correct output.

## Setup

Copy `data.js` from https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-tutorials/mnist_data.js.
